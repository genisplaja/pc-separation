### Source Separation of Piano Concertos
This repository addresses the novel and rarely considered source separation task of decomposing piano concerto recordings into separate piano and orchestral tracks. 
Being a genre written for a pianist typically accompanied by an ensemble or orchestra, piano concertos often involve an intricate interplay of the piano and the entire orchestra,
leading to high spectroâ€“temporal correlations between the constituent instruments. 
Moreover, in the case of piano concertos, the lack of multi-track data for training constitutes another challenge in view of data-driven source separation approaches. 
As a basis for our work, we adapt existing deep learning (DL) techniques, mainly used for the separation of popular music recordings. 
In particular, we investigate spectrogram- and waveform-based approaches  as well as hybrid models operating in both spectrogram and waveform domains. 
As a main contribution, we introduce a musically motivated data augmentation approach for training based on artificially generated samples. 
Furthermore, we systematically investigate the effects of various augmentation techniques for DL-based models. 
For our experiments, we use [PCD](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/PCD), an open-source dataset of multi-track piano concerto recordings.
Our main findings demonstrate that the best source separation performance is achieved by a hybrid model when combining all augmentation techniques.
